## About

---

I am a third-year PhD student searching for radio transients, but with an interest in all transient behaviour.

I am the Principal Investigator on a project to observe radio afterglows of gravitational wave events with the Australia Telescope Compact Array, for which we have been allocated 750 hours of observing time. I am also a member of the JAGWAR collaboration, which uses the worlds leading radio facilities for gravitational wave follow-up and am a co-Investigator on proposals with the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder, the Very Large Array, and the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope.

You can find my CV <a href="/pdf/CV.pdf" target='_blank'>here</a> and read about my [publications](#publications), [teaching](#teaching) and [outreach](#outreach-and-media) below.


## Publications

---

I have written 4 first-author papers and am a co-author on 12 more. My h-index is 10 with over 1900 total citations. I also regularly publish transients results circulated via the <a href="http://www.astronomerstelegram.org">Astronomer's Telegram</a> and the <a href="https://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/gcn3_archive.html">Gamma-ray Coordinates Network</a>.

An ADS library containing my refereed publications can be found <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/public-libraries/PCsVV4a_S--oQvEwCMNCGA">here</a>, while summaries of all of my publications can be found <a href="/publications">here</a>. Some highlights can be found below

## Teaching

---

Along with general tuition of various undergraduate physics courses, I helped develop <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-driven-astronomy">Data Driven Astronomy</a>, offered by the University of Sydney via Coursera, which was awarded The Vice Chancellor's Award for Outstanding Educational Engagement and Innovation in 2018.

<br>
I have also developed modules for the <a href="http://growth.caltech.edu/growth-winter-school-2018.html">GROWTH Winter School 2018</a> and <a href="http://growth.caltech.edu/growth-school-2019.html">GROWTH Summer School 2019</a> that teach students how to use <a href="https://emcee.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">emcee</a> for lightcurve fitting. I presented a similar module as an invited speaker at the <a href="https://indico.skatelescope.org/event/564/">5th SKA Summer School</a> at the Shanghai Astronomical Observatory.

## Outreach and Media

---

I have a strong passion for communicating my research to the public and have had the opportunity to do that at Sydney Observatory since 2016. In 2017 I spent two weeks working as the CAASTRO Astronomer In Residence at Uluru, and have given talks to high schools, undergraduate students and the general public throughout the course of my PhD.

My involvement in the first discovery of a neutron star merger attracted national media attention, including articles in the <a href="https://www.smh.com.au/technology/revelation-of-cosmic-secrets-triggers-a-frenzy-of-global-scientific-activity-20171016-gz1hmw.html">Sydney Morning Herald</a>, <a href="https://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/health-science/neutron-star-collision-a-turning-point-in-scientific-history/news-story/45d782fc44bcc447dd7abbd831bd709d">The Australian</a> and <a href="https://theconversation.com/after-the-alert-radio-eyes-hunt-the-source-of-the-gravitational-waves-85106">The Conversation</a>.
